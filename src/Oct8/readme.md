Create a Book class in Java. The class should demonstrate 
the concept of constructor chaining, where one constructor calls 
another constructor within the same class.

Requirements:
The Book class should have three constructors:

A [default constructor] that sets the book title to "Unknown" and the author to "Unknown".
A constructor with one parameter that accepts the title and sets the author to "Unknown".
A constructor with two parameters that accepts both the title and the author.
Use constructor chaining to call one constructor from another within the class.

Create a main() method to test the class by creating instances of the Book 
class using different constructors.
